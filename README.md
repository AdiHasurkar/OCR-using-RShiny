# What is the app about?
Textify allows the user to extract text from an image that can be shared across any device and platform.
It is as simple as it sounds!

# Requirements
There are no specific requirements to run the app and it can be accessed from any device that supports a browser and a stable internet connection. 
To see it in action, click [here](https://adityahasurkar.shinyapps.io/Textify/).

If you are looking to build on your local machine, you will need to create a folder named 'www' which will contain your default image and anything else if you wish to add. Your app.r file should remain outside of this folder and should be your working directory. 

# What problem does it solve?
Textify is made for those who like to store image data in their devices and wish to free up some storage space by extracting text from those images and storing it in text format instead. If you're looking for a quick solution that could help do this job without any costs then look no more. 
Below is an example that demonstrates the accuracy and feasibility of the app !
