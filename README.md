# What is the app about?
Textify allows the user to extract text from an image that can be shared across any device and platform.
It is as simple as it sounds!

# Requirements
There are no specific requirements to run the app and it can be accessed from any device that supports a browser and a stable internet connection. 
To see it in action, click [here](https://adityahasurkar.shinyapps.io/Textify/).

If you are looking to build on your local machine, you will need to create a folder named 'www' which will contain your default image and anything else if you wish to add. Your app.r file should remain outside of this folder and should be your working directory. 

# How to use the app?
1. You can start by uploading your own image to the app by clicking on 'Browse' on the main screen. 
2. Once the image is uploaded and you have read the introduction page, click on 'Image and Extracted Tab' which gives you required results. 
3. Next, click on 'Extracted Text as Sentences' tab if you're looking for a specific sentence in your text. You also have an option to search using keywords. 
4. If your image has been recognised correctly, you should be able to check awesome visualisation of your text by clicking 'Word Cloud' tab. 
   - In this tab, you can try varying the number of words in cloud by using the slider on left hand side of the screen. There is also an option to change minimum number of words in cloud by changing the value using circular knob. 
   - If you fancy to visualise only nouns in your text, hit 'Remove Stopwords' button and a new wordcloud will be generated. 
5. Do not forget to check out the 'FAQ' section to learn more.
